# LiteralSeaglideUpgrades
My Litteral Seaglide Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator, where you craft the Seaglide. Press V when holding a Seaglide to access the Upgrades! 

## How to install:

1. Ensure you have BepInEx and Nautilus installed, if you do not, the mod will not work.
2. If you have Subnautica Mod Manager: Create a folder in BepInEx's plugin folder in your game files to put the DLL in
3. Download the DLL. Need it to actually have the mod work
4. Put the DLL in the plugins folder. If you have Subnautica Mod Manager, put the DLL in the folder you created in step 2.

## Known Bugs: 

None! I dare you to brake this version without de-compiling it! 

## Update News:

v0.2.0 on the way! It may have a promised release feature!

## Some other notes: 
I will **not** be updating any source code unless asked to do so on discord or by an Issue report.
