## Known Bugs: 

None! I dare you to break this version without de-compiling it! 

## Compatibility Issues:

I am currently aware that this mod breaks Ramune's SeaglideUpgrades. I'm working on a fix over the next few weeks for either v0.1.5 or v0.2.0.

## Update News:

v0.2.0 on the way! It may have a promised release feature!

## Some other notes: 
I will update source code every time a (somewhat) major version is released (Example: v0.2.0, v0.3.0, etc. Or a promised feature or different feature gets added)
