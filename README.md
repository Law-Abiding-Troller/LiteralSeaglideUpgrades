# LiteralSeaglideUpgrades
My Litteral Seaglide Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator, where you craft the Seaglide. Press V when holding a Seaglide to access the Upgrades! 

## How to install:

1. Ensure you have BepInEx and Nautilus installed, if you do not, the mod will not work.
2. Find releases on the left of this repository just under the about section
3. Download the ZIP file (should be labeled LiteralSeaglideUpgradesv0.1.4.zip)
4. Unzip (Extract) the ZIP file to BepInEx's plugins folder

## Known Bugs: 

None! I dare you to break this version without de-compiling it! 

## Compatibility Issues:

I am currently aware that this mod breaks Ramune's SeaglideUpgrades. I'm working on a fix over the next few weeks for either v0.1.5 or v0.2.0.

## Update News:

v0.2.0 on the way! It may have a promised release feature!

## Some other notes: 
I will update source code every time a (somewhat) major version is released (Example: v0.2.0, v0.3.0, etc. Or a promised feature or different feature gets added)
