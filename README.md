# LiteralSeaglideUpgrades
My Litteral Seaglide Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator, where you craft the Seaglide. Press V when holding a Seaglide to access the Upgrades! 

## How to install:

1. Ensure you have BepInEx and Nautilus installed, if you do not, the mod will not work.
2. If you have Subnautica Mod Manager: Create a folder in BepInEx's plugin folder in your game files to put the DLL in
3. Download the DLL. Need it to actually have the mod work
4. Put the DLL in the plugins folder. If you have Subnautica Mod Manager, put the DLL in the folder you created in step 2.

## Known Bugs: 

When quickly switching between Seaglides in the hot bar, it will not update speed unless opening the new Seaglide's container. 

## Update News:

v0.2.0 on the way!

v0.1.4 will include some bug fixes and maybe some other stuff. It should come out this week.

### NOTE:
I have recived information and a test build of Seaglide Upgrades (actually from the Subnautica Modding discord server, to find it you can just search for it on discord) from Ramune. This mod will **never** be directely compatible for Ramune's Seaglide Upgrades.
#### What this means:

v0.1.4 will take a shorter amount of time to complete. Same with v0.2.0. However, when it releases will depend on my own time management.

## Some other notes: 
I will **not** be updating any source code unless asked to do so on discord or by an Issue report.
