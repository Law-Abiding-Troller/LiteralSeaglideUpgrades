# LiteralSeaglideUpgrades
My Litteral Seaglide Upgrades Subnautica mod. Requires Nautilus. Currently not compatible with Ramune's SeaglideUpgrades mod...even though its unreleased. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator, where you craft the Seaglide. Press V when holding a Seaglide to access the Upgrades!
